# Architectural Plan

## 1. WebRTC Implementation Strategy

### Real-time Communication Features Needed:

-   Audio and video conferencing
-   Screen sharing
-   Text chat
-   Data channels for custom data transfer

### WebRTC Architecture and Components:

-   **Signaling Server:** Handles session negotiation and exchange of SDP (Session Description Protocol) offers/answers and ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates.
    -   Technology: Node.js with Socket.IO or WebSockets
-   **STUN/TURN Servers:** Facilitate NAT (Network Address Translation) traversal and relay traffic when direct connections are not possible.
    -   Coturn server
-   **WebRTC API:** Used in the client-side application (browser or mobile app) to establish peer-to-peer connections.
    -   JavaScript API

### Security Considerations:

-   **Encryption:** All WebRTC traffic is encrypted using DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) for data streams and SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) for audio and video.
-   **Signaling Security:** Secure the signaling channel using HTTPS and WSS (WebSocket Secure) to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
-   **Authentication:** Implement user authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
-   **ICE Candidate Handling:** Carefully validate ICE candidates to prevent attacks.

### Scalability Approach:

-   **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit):** Use an SFU server to handle multi-party calls, forwarding media streams to participants instead of creating a full mesh.
    -   Technology: медиасервер Janus, Jitsi Videobridge
-   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple SFU servers to handle a large number of concurrent calls.
-   **Autoscaling:** Automatically scale SFU servers based on demand.

## 2. Deployment Infrastructure

### Server Architecture:

-   Similar to Jitsi, but with our own implementation using microservices.
-   **Microservices:**
    -   **Signaling Service:** Handles WebRTC signaling.
    -   **SFU Service:** Manages media streams.
    -   **Authentication Service:** Handles user authentication.
    -   **API Gateway:** Provides a single entry point for all client requests.

### Scaling Strategy:

-   **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale microservices horizontally by adding more instances.
-   **Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize microservices for easy deployment and scaling.
-   **Orchestration:** Use Kubernetes to orchestrate containers and manage scaling.

### Required Services and Components:

-   **Load Balancers:** Distribute traffic across microservice instances.
-   **Databases:** Store user data, session information, and call history.
    -   PostgreSQL, MongoDB
-   **Message Queue:** Asynchronously communicate between microservices.
    -   RabbitMQ, Kafka
-   **Object Storage:** Store recordings and other media files.
    -   AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage

### Security Measures:

-   **Network Security:** Use firewalls and network segmentation to isolate microservices.
-   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
-   **Encryption:** Encrypt all data at rest and in transit.

## 3. Project Management Tools Structure

### Core Features Needed:

-   Task management
-   Bug tracking
-   Roadmap planning
-   Team collaboration
-   Reporting and analytics

### Data Model:

-   **Projects:**
    -   ID
    -   Name
    -   Description
    -   Status
    -   Start Date
    -   End Date
-   **Tasks:**
    -   ID
    -   Project ID
    -   Name
    -   Description
    -   Status
    -   Assignee
    -   Priority
    -   Due Date
-   **Users:**
    -   ID
    -   Name
    -   Email
    -   Role

### API Endpoints:

-   `/projects`: GET, POST
-   `/projects/:id`: GET, PUT, DELETE
-   `/projects/:id/tasks`: GET, POST
-   `/tasks/:id`: GET, PUT, DELETE
-   `/users`: GET, POST
-   `/users/:id`: GET, PUT, DELETE

### Component Architecture:

-   **Frontend:**
    -   React
    -   Redux or Zustand for state management
    -   UI component library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
-   **Backend:**
    -   Node.js with Express
    -   Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
    -   ORM (e.g., Sequelize, Mongoose)

## Summary of Architectural Decisions

This architectural plan outlines a strategy for implementing real-time communication features using WebRTC, deploying a scalable infrastructure, and structuring project management tools. The key decisions include:

-   Using an SFU architecture for WebRTC to handle multi-party calls efficiently.
-   Implementing a microservices-based architecture for deployment to ensure scalability and maintainability.
-   Selecting appropriate technologies for each component based on performance, security, and scalability requirements.
-   Defining a clear data model and API endpoints for the project management tools.
